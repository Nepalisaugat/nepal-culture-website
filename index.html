        <h1>Welcome to Nepal</h1>
        <p>Nepal is a landlocked country nestled in the Himalayas.
            Nepal is home to the Himalayas, including Mount Everest (Sagarmatha), the world’s highest peak. Beyond its snow-capped mountains, 
            the country features lush valleys, rolling hills, and fertile plains in the Terai region, offering a diverse and breathtaking landscape.
             Nepal is also celebrated for its rich cultural and historical heritage, being the birthplace of Lord Gautama Buddha in Lumbini and a melting pot of traditions influenced by Hinduism and Buddhism. Kathmandu, the capital city, is known as the "City of Temples" for its intricate architecture and sacred monuments, 
             such as Pashupatinath Temple and Swayambhunath. The country’s diverse population, comprising numerous ethnic groups like the Newars, Sherpas, and Gurungs, speaks over 120 languages, reflecting a vibrant cultural tapestry.</p>
